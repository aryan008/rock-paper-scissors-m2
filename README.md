As per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors), “Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors". It is one of the first games we learn to play growing up, and I have fond memories playing in it in the Schoolyard and with my Family. Hence, the creation of this game using HTML, CSS & JavaScript will allow me to develop my skills.

The aim of this site is to allow the user of the site to participate in this game online. Users will experience:
*	a welcome/rules page where the user can pick the “best of X” games to play
*	a loading page
*	a playing page where they can participate in the Rock, Paper, Scissors (“RPS” hereafter) game against the “computer”
*	instant feedback whether they won, lost or drew the hand played
*	to see if they are winning/losing/drawing by following their score against the “computer”
*	an overall winner/loser of the game

The site is designed to be responsive and accessible across all device sizes, as defined in the testing section of this ReadMe file.
The site is also designed on a “single” webpage. However, the user interaction by virtue of “clicks” on buttons will allow the site user to experience different elements of the same page through the use of JavaScript.
